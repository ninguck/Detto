This saves you the most money mathematically.\n\n*Example: Credit card at 22% APR gets priority over student loan at 6% APR*\n\n**‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowball Method**\nPay minimums on all debts, then attack the smallest balance first. This builds momentum through quick wins.\n\n*Example: $500 store card gets eliminated before $15,000 car loan*"

The best method is the one you'll actually follow through with.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Combine both! Start with one small debt (snowball) to build confidence, then switch to avalanche for maximum savings."
